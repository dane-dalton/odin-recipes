# odin-recipes
Basic recipes project challenge on The Odin Project.

A way to practice the skills I am learning to move them into my muscle memory. This project currently has a focus on HTML, with the introduction of CSS later in the course.

I would like to focus on making the website as easy on the eyes as possible, to make reading it an enjoyable user experience. Organization of HTML elements will be kept in mind throughout the process.
