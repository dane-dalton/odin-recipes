                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>These are some unforgettable sliders by Chef John from <a href="https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2019/01/meatball-stuffed-garlic-bread-sliders.html" target="_blank">Food Wishes</a>. Not only are these sliders relatively easy to make, they are a fun way for you to share your <em>delicious</em> creation with your friends and family!</p>
                <p>In this recipe, you will learn how to make these incredible, shareable meatball sliders. As stated previously: this recipe is much easier than it seems. Using Hawaiian rolls ensures that all we must deal with is whatever we would like to stuff them with. This recipe will show you how to make meatball sliders, but I have made buffalo chicken and onion sliders using this same method with excellent results, so get creative!</p>

                    <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>

                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded fontina cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>18 dinner rolls (I like the sweet Hawaiian rolls)</li>
                    <li>2 cups spicy tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prehead oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 2 cloves garlic - cook and stir until onion is soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place beef in a bowl along with onion/garlic mix from Step 2, parsley, egg, bread crumbs, and ~1/2 of the fontina cheese (the rest is for topping). Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix by hand until combined. Scoop meat mixture into 24 mini muffin cups, or create small meatballs to your liking.</li>
                    <li>Bake in a preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers, ~12 minutes. Leave oven on. Let meatballs cool briefly while you make the garlic butter.</li>
                    <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining minced garlic once butter starts to bubble - stir, then immediately remove from heat. Stir well and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil - coat foil with remaining olive oil. Transfer rolls, still attached, to the baking sheet. Cut a hole in the top of each roll, reaching ~2/3 of the way down. Brush garlic butter over the insides and outsides of the rolls.</li>
                    <li>Bake until golden brown, ~8 minutes. Pour about 1 tablespoon tomato sauce into each hole. Stuff meatballs into the holes. Top each roll with a spoonful of tomato sauce and remaining fontina cheese. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.</li>
                    <li>Continue baking until cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Garnish with more parsley. Let rolls sit for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up - transfer to a serving playyer.</li>
