        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are some unforgettable sliders by Chef John from <a href="https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2019/01/meatball-stuffed-garlic-bread-sliders.html" target="_blank">Food Wishes</a>. Not only are these sliders relatively easy to make, they are a fun way for you to share your <em>delicious</em> creation with your friends and family!</p>
        <p>In this recipe, you will learn how to make these incredible, shareable meatball sliders. As stated previously: this recipe is much easier than it seems. Using Hawaiian rolls ensures that all we must deal with is whatever we would like to stuff them with. This recipe will show you how to make meatball sliders, but I have made buffalo chicken and onion sliders using this same method with excellent results, so get creative!</p>
