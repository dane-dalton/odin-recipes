    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chia seed pudding was one of those recipes I wish I had discovered earlier. Being as easy as it is to make, it surprises anyone who tries it for the first time how tasty it can be. Even better? You can completely transform this recipe to your desire by adding whatever mix-ins you like! My go to is mango, mini chocolate chips, and coconut. That being said, I don't think I have tried any toppings or mix-ins I have not liked in chia seed pudding. This recipe makes 4 servings, although do not be surprised if you have it all in one go.
