    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Another recipe from Chef John at <a href="https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/01/recipe-666-deviled-eggs-damn-these-were.html" target="_blank">Food Wishes</a>. These deviled eggs have become my go to when bringing an appetizer to gatherings with friends or family. Growing up, this was my Uncle's go to app, and the torch had eventually been passed to me. This recipe does every step perfectly, and the candied fresno peppers on top make them stand out like no other. The sweet heat and crunch they give always leave guests with nothing but compliments to the chef.

    <p>These may look complicated, but they are actually quite easy. If you have made egg salad before, the process is nearly identical. The only difference is the presentation. The simplicity of their look, the color contrast, and their ease of consumption are something to remember.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 fresno pepper, or jalepeno, sliced into thin rings</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Sriracha or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover the pot and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the warm sugar syrup over the pepper rings in a small bowl. Stir gently and set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain eggs and fill the pan with very cold water. Let eggs sit in cold water until they are cool enough to handle, ~15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a bowl and cover the egg white halves with a damp towel while you prepare the filling to keep them from drying out.</li>
        <li>Mash together egg yolks, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Sriracha, and Dijon mustard until just combined. Stir in rice vinegar until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Pipe filling into the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Top each egg with a ring of candied pepper and chopped chives. Chill for at least 20 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
